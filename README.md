🚖 Ola Booking Analysis – Complete SQL Data Exploration Project

This project presents an in-depth SQL-based analysis of Ola ride booking data, aimed at understanding user behavior, service efficiency, cancellation trends, and rating patterns. Using a well-structured bookings dataset, the project applies multiple SQL queries and views to extract valuable insights that can help ride-sharing platforms enhance performance and customer satisfaction.

The analysis begins by filtering all successfully completed bookings, which forms the foundation for understanding operational success rates. It then calculates the average ride distance for each vehicle type, allowing comparison between bikes, autos, sedans, and other ride categories. This insight helps identify which vehicle type is used for short or long-distance travel patterns.

The study also focuses on cancellation behavior. It retrieves the total number of rides cancelled by customers, highlighting user-side issues and potential improvement areas. Additionally, cancellations made by drivers due to personal or car-related issues are analyzed, providing visibility into driver-side challenges that may affect service quality. 

To understand customer engagement, the project identifies the top five customers with the highest number of bookings, enabling targeted marketing and reward strategies. It also retrieves all rides paid through UPI, an increasingly popular digital payment method, offering insights into user payment preferences.

Service quality is assessed by analyzing driver ratings, especially focusing on Prime Sedan bookings. The maximum and minimum ratings give a performance range for premium services. Moreover, the average customer rating per vehicle type is computed and ranked, helping determine which ride categories achieve the highest customer satisfaction.

Business performance is evaluated by calculating the total booking value of successfully completed rides, which indicates total revenue generated from completed trips. The project concludes by listing all incomplete rides along with the reasons, making it easier to identify operational bottlenecks or system issues affecting ride completion. 

Overall, this project demonstrates strong SQL skills, including data filtering, grouping, aggregations, view creation, and analytical queries. It delivers a comprehensive understanding of real-world ride-sharing datasets and highlights how data-driven insights can improve customer experience, reduce cancellations, optimize operations, and support strategic business decisions.
